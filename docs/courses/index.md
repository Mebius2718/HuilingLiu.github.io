<p>In this note, I organized the lectures from <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Prof. Huiyuan Wang&rsquo;s</a>
 course &ldquo;the Large-scale Structures&rdquo; and made some adjustments to the sequence of the taught material according to my own preferences. While compiling these notes, Professor Mo&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Large-scale Structures&rdquo; also played a significant role.</p>
<p>The content of these notes is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Basic knowledge of cosmology.</li>
<li>Chapter 2: Brief introduction to linear theory.</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Methods and systematic errors in testing cosmology and linear theory, as well as probing the cosmic density fields.</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Introduction to some nonlinear theories, including the Spherical Collapse Models, PS (Press-Schechter) theory, and EPS (Excursion Set Press-Schechter) theory.</li>
</ul>
