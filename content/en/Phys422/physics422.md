## Description

Welcome to Phys422 (Fall 2022-?). These pages aims to give my roommates some overview of my recent work in astrophysics and some impressive topics covered in classes, developing their abilities to disguise as a professional astronomer.

That's kidding. If you have some idea on pretending to be a astronomer,  please [email](lhl2718281@mail.ustc.edu.cn "lhl2718281@mail.ustc.edu.cn") me lol. 

**Seriously**, **Phys422** is consists of **physics** and my dormitory number **422** to pretend it as a course id. 

Because all my roommates are physics majors with different field(Theoretical physics or astronomy, condensed-matter physics and quantum information), we have different classes during senior grades. Meanwhile, we are also interested in other fields. So in our spare time, we try to start from the basic principles and introduce to others to our latest work and interesting knowledge learned in class.

I plan to use these pages to record part of the topic I shared. It will be done after my TOEFL test.
