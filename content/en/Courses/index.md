## Notes

### The Large Scale Structure

In this note, I organized the lectures from [Prof. Huiyuan Wang's](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/index.html) course "the Large-scale Structures" and made some adjustments to the sequence of the taught material according to my own preferences. While compiling these notes, Professor Mo's book "Large-scale Structures" also played a significant role.

The content of these notes is as follows.
+ Chapter 1: Basic knowledge of cosmology.
+ Chapter 2: Brief introduction to linear theory.
+ Chapter 3: Methods and systematic errors in testing cosmology and linear theory, as well as probing the cosmic density fields.
+ Chapter 4: Introduction to some nonlinear theories, including the Spherical Collapse Models, PS (Press-Schechter) theory, and EPS (Excursion Set Press-Schechter) theory.
