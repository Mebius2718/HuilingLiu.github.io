# Grades

Click [here](../docs/grade.pdf) to get my scholastic record. I have also listed learned courses and their grades on this page.

The courses' exam in Fall 2022 have been postponed in view of the rising COVID-19 cases in China. So I don't have grades for this semester yet.

| Semester| Credits | Overall GPA | Score|
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 2020FA | 33.5 | 3.73 | 88.71 |
| 2021SP | 31.5 | 3.84 | 90.25 |
| 2021FA | 37.5 | 3.89 | 90.31 |
| 2022SP | 31.5 | 3.92 | 91.57 |
| 2022FA | 33 | ? | ? |


I use '?' to mark the courses that haven't been graded yet and convert five-point scale to percentile scale.
