# About me

Hello! My name is Huiling Liu(刘会凌). I'm a undergraduate student majoring in Theoretical Physics at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Currently, I am engaged in work related to **galaxy formation and evolution** in the [Prof. Huiyuan Wang (王慧元)'s](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/index.html) group.

Here's my [Curriculum Vitae](../docs/HuilingLiu_CV.pdf).

## Education
#### **Fall 2020-Now**
* **B.S.in Theoretical Physics, USTC**
* **Overall GPA:** 3.85/4.30(90.17/100)
* **Ranking**: 36/310 in School of Physical Science, 27/310 in last academic year

## Research Experience
#### Sep2022-Now
* **Topic:** The Duty Cycle of Radio Galaxies.
* **Credit:** First contributor.
* **Supervisor:** [Prof. Huiyuan Wang (USTC)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/index.html)
* **Aims:** Understanding the process by which massive galaxies and radio galaxies transform into each other. Investigating the correlation between radio galaxies' duty-cycle and their properties.
* **State:** Currently being written.
* **Abstract:** Galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful measurement technique that provides a direct way to map the distribution of dark matter around galaxies. In this work, We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing on SDSS catalog to constrain the halo parameters of different types of galaxies.

#### Sep2023-Now
* **Topic:** Halo ellipticity measurement on DESI galaxies through weak lensing
* **Credit:** First contributor.
* **Supervisor:** [Prof. Alexie Leauthaud (UCSC)](https://alexie.sites.ucsc.edu/)
* **Aims:** Understand the shape and distribution of dark matter halos around galaxies. Providing constraints on the IA(Intrinsic Alignment) model.
* **State:** In prep.
* **Abstract:** In large-scale cosmic surveys, the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies presents a significant source of systematic error in the measurement of cosmic shear, an essential aspect of weak gravitational lensing studies. By accurately measuring the ellipticity of dark matter halos, we can directly constrain the IA model, enhancing the precision in our measurements of cosmological parameters. This work utilizes the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to measure halo ellipticity by meticulously analyze second-order angular term of weak lensing signal.

The universe is strong, but life is stronger.[^1] As a beginner of astronomy and astrophysics, I am always glad to make the leap into areas that are wider and unfamiliar.
[^1]: *Death's End* by Cixin Liu:
"Do you think life is nothing but a fragile, thin, soft shell clinging to the surface of this planet?"
"Isn't it?"
"Only if you neglect the power of time. If a colony of ants continue to move clods the size of grains of rice they could remove all of Mount Tai in a billion years. As long as you give it enough time, life is stronger than metal and stone, more powerful than typhoons and volcanoes."
